# React Dummy Login Page

This is a simple React application that demonstrates a login and logout page.

## Installation

To use this app, you first need to clone this github repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Joulence/react-course-learning-app-4.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the app, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the app in the development mode and open it in your default browser.

The login page contains a simple form where you can enter your username and password. If you enter valid credentials, you will be taken to the home page. If you enter invalid credentials, you will see an error message.

Once you are logged in, you can log out by clicking the logout button.
